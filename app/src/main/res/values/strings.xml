    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Aleks.
        \n\nI love fish.
        \n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
        \nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
        \n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
        \nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
        \nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
        \n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
        \n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
        \nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n

    <string name="bio_tabby">A tabby is any domestic cat (Felis catus) with a distinctive \'M\' shaped marking on its forehead,
        stripes by its eyes and across its cheeks, along its back, and around its legs and tail, and (differing by tabby type),
        characteristic striped, dotted, lined, flecked, banded or swirled patterns on the bodyâ€”neck, shoulders, sides, flanks,
        chest and abdomen.
        \n\n\"Tabby\" is not a breed of cat but a coat type seen in almost all genetic lines of domestic cats, regardless of status.
        \n\nThe tabby pattern is found in many official cat breeds and is a hallmark of the landrace extremely common among the general population of cats around the world.
        \n\nThe tabby pattern occurs naturally and is connected both to the coat of the domestic cat\'s direct ancestor and to those of their close relatives:
        the African wildcat (Felis lybica lybica), the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris) and the Asiatic wildcat (Felis lybica ornata),
        all of which have similar coats, both by pattern and coloration.
        A genetic study of tabbies found five genetic clusters to be ancestral to cats of various parts of the world.
